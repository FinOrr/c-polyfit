## Overview

**PolyFit** is a C library designed to facilitate accurate polynomial fitting for curve approximation, allowing for interpolation and extrapolation of data points. Enhance your data analysis capabilities with this efficient and versatile tool!

## Features

- Polynomial fitting for curve approximation.
- Interpolation and extrapolation functionality for predicting additional data points.
- Lightweight and easy-to-integrate into existing C projects.

## Usage

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FinOrr/polyfit.git
```

Build the library:

```bash
cd polyfit
make
```

### Usage

TInclude 

### Example

See the demo.c program for example usage.
To build the demo, you'll need CMake installed.

Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing your source files and the CMakeLists.txt, and run the following commands:

`
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
`

This will generate the build files. Once the files are generated, you can build your project by running:
`
make
`

This will compile your source files and create the executable. If you want to clean the generated files, you can run:
`
make clean
`

The resulting executable will be in the build directory.
